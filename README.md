JWT-based Authentication Application in Java with Spring Boot

This project is a simple JWT-based authentication application built using Java and the Spring Boot framework. It includes the essential Spring Web and Spring Security dependencies to enable secure authentication.

The application exposes a single endpoint mapped to "/authenticate". This endpoint is a REST HTTP POST API that expects a request body containing a username and password. Upon successful authentication, the endpoint generates an authentication token using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and returns it as part of the response.

The JWT-based authentication ensures that the user's credentials are securely validated, and the generated token can be used to authenticate subsequent requests to protected resources on the server.

With this project, you can quickly set up a secure authentication mechanism in your Java-based web applications, providing a foundation for building more complex and secure systems.
